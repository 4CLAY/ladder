# ladder

## Overview

The **ladder** project aims to create an automated solution for deploying nodes using Terraform. This project is designed to simplify the process of setting up and managing infrastructure in a cloud environment, specifically targeting Azure.

## Objectives

- **Automated Node Deployment**: Utilize Terraform to automate the provisioning of virtual machines and associated resources, reducing manual setup time and minimizing human error.
  
- **Node Monitoring**: Implement monitoring solutions to track the status and performance of deployed nodes, ensuring they are running optimally and are accessible.

- **Update Mechanism**: Establish a process for updating nodes seamlessly, allowing for easy maintenance and upgrades without significant downtime.

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All configurations are defined in Terraform scripts, enabling version control and reproducibility of the infrastructure.

- **Dynamic Resource Management**: Resources such as virtual networks, subnets, public IPs, and network security groups are created dynamically based on user-defined variables.

- **User Data Configuration**: Custom scripts can be executed on node startup through user data, allowing for initial setup and configuration of the environment.

- **Security**: Network security groups are configured to allow necessary traffic (e.g., SSH and HTTPS) while maintaining a secure environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ladder project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ladder
   ```

2. **Install Terraform**: Ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

3. **Install Azure CLI**: Follow the instructions to install the Azure CLI from the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

4. **Azure Login**: Run the following command to log in to your Azure account:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

5. **Configure Variables**: Update the `variables.tf` file with your desired configurations, such as resource group location and username.

6. **Initialize Terraform**: Run the following command to initialize the Terraform environment:
   ```bash
   terraform init -upgrade
   ```

7. **Plan the Deployment**: Generate an execution plan to see what resources will be created:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

8. **Apply the Configuration**: Deploy the infrastructure by applying the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
